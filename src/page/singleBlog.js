                                Management Platform</h3>

                            <p className='text-white mt-5 w-[80%] Gilroy text-base'>The reputation of any business runs not only with the services or products it offers but also on its
                                honour to fulfil commitments. But what if a business has a good number of customers? Won’t it be
                                difficult to manage and track the promises and guarantees offered? Here comes the importance of
                                warranty management software. Before we discuss the <b> features of warranty software </b>, let’s give a
                                short analogy of how warranty management software works.</p>

                    <div className='grid grid-cols-12 gap-4'>

                            <h2 className='text-white text-2xl Brockmann'>An Analogy of How Warranty Management Software Works</h2>
                            <p className='text-white mt-5 text-left mx-auto Gilroy text-base'>
                                For example, your company bakes cake. To get a good customer base and trustworthiness, you need
                                to promise something worthy, like “freshness,” or you can promise to replace if the cake is stale.
                                Now, the problem comes when you need to track too many orders. Tracking on pen and paper
                                becomes too messy. What if a promise is made twice? What if the warranty has expired?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A warranty management software comes to the rescue in this situation. It is a “super organized
                                notebook” that helps keep track of all promises and warranties made to the customers, along with
                                the services and products, the number of offers, who the offer is for, and the time limit. Also, you
                                need to check if the customer complaints are valid. A warranty management software helps like a
                                “trusted manager” to keep track of what all are in the warranty. Not only these, but this software
                                also functions as a “security guard” that manages if the complaint is valid and legitimate and the
                                warranty is processed further. Finally, the warranty management software functions as a
                                “detective” that finds flaws in the services or products delivered and helps create a better customer
                                experience in the future.
